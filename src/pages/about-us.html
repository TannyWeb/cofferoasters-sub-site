                <p>
                    Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999, highlighting stories of coffee from
                    around the world. We
                    have since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew - in every shipment.

                        <h2>Our commitment</h2>
                        <p>We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to make
                            it
                            easy for you to
                            discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source. To locate
                            the
                            specific lots we want to
                            purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and
                            opportunities
                            in each of these places.
                            We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers and empower a global community of farmers
                            through
                            with well above
                            fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer training, support farm community initiatives, and
                            invest in
                            coffee plant science.
                            Curating only the finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive
                            to
                            their native growing
                            region.</p>

                    <h2>Uncompromising quality</h2>
                    <p>Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, we
                        employ, on our end, a
                        rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of
                        coffee is tagged with a
                        roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast
                        consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
